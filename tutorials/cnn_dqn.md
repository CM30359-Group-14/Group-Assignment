To adapt the code for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a replay buffer that contains stacked images, you'll need to make the following changes:

1. Modify the `Network` class to accept image input and use CNN layers instead of fully connected layers.
2. Modify the `ReplayBuffer` class to stack a specified number of image frames together.
3. Adjust the input handling in the `DQNAgent` class to work with image observations (stacked frames) rather than vector observations.

Here's how you can do that:

### 1. Modify `Network` class
You'll need to change the architecture of the `Network` class to work with image input.

```Python
class CNNNetwork(nn.Module):

    def __init__(self, input_shape: tuple, out_dim: int, num_frames: int):
        super().__init__()

        self.input_shape = input_shape
        self.out_dim = out_dim
        self.num_frames = num_frames

        self.features = nn.Sequential(
            # Assuming input_shape is (channels, height, width)
            nn.Conv2d(self.num_frames * self.input_shape[0], 32, kernel_size=8, stride=4),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=4, stride=2),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv2d(64, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=1),
            nn.ReLU()
        )

        self.fc_input_dim = self.feature_size()

        self.fc = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(self.fc_input_dim, 512),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(512, self.out_dim)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.features(x)
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

    def feature_size(self):
        return self.features(autograd.Variable(torch.zeros(1, *self.input_shape))).view(1, -1).size(1)
```

### 2. Modify `ReplayBuffer` class
The `ReplayBuffer` class should now store image frames stacked along a new dimension.

```Python
class ReplayBuffer:
    def __init__(self, obs_shape: tuple, size: int, batch_size: int = 32, num_frames: int = 4):
        self.obs_shape = (obs_shape[0] * num_frames, *obs_shape[1:])
        self.obs_buf = np.zeros((size, *self.obs_shape), dtype=np.float32)
        # ... other buffers remain the same
        self.num_frames = num_frames
        self.frame_idx = 0
        self.obs = np.zeros((num_frames, *obs_shape), dtype=np.float32)

    def store_frame(self, frame: np.ndarray):
        self.obs[self.frame_idx % self.num_frames] = frame
        self.frame_idx += 1
        if self.frame_idx % self.num_frames == 0:
            self.obs_buf[self.ptr] = self.obs.flatten()
            self.ptr = (self.ptr + 1) % self.max_size
            self.size = min(self.size + 1, self.max_size)

    def get_stacked_obs(self, idx):
        return self.obs_buf[idx].reshape(self.num_frames, *self.obs_shape[1:])

    # Other methods remain mostly unchanged, but make sure to use `get_stacked_obs`.
```

### 3. Modify `DQNAgent` class

You will need to adjust the agent to work with the environment's image observations and update the storage mechanism to stack the frames properly.

- When storing a transition, use `store_frame` to replace `store` and call it each time an image frame is received from the environment.
- When sampling a batch, make sure the observations are correctly reshaped into the form the modified CNN expects.

You'll also need to modify `select_action`, `step`, and other methods that handle the state and actions to be compatible with the stacked frames and CNN.

Additionally, update your `train` method to pre-process the image frames before they're passed into the network if your environment provides raw pixel data. This could include normalizing pixel values, converting to grayscale, resizing, etc.

Remember that these are guidelines, and the actual implementation may require some debugging and additional changes to work with your specific environment and use case.
